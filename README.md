# Focality

**Concept:**
A virtual study/work platform that uses the Pomodoro technique. Users can join or create “rooms” to work together in timed sessions, compete on leaderboards, earn badges/levels, and engage in brief post-session chats. The goal is to build a productive, community-driven environment that gamifies work sessions.

**Target Audience:**  
Students, remote workers, and anyone interested in staying productive by leveraging community and gamification.
